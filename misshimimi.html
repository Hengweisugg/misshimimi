    <h1>Mimi Chou is a dog</h1>
    <p class="one">My mentor Mimi Chou asked me to draw this damn cat. She is an astronomer, a life designer, and a presidential candidate.<br />
        She is also a dog, but she is too ill to admit that and she always think herself a cat. Nevertheless, she is my best friend and I want her happy, so I decided to use CSS to draw a picture of her in her imagination.<br />
